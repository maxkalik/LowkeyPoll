# Lowkey Poll concept

## Task

1. Based on design for a new feature create the UI and some basic functionality (textinput handlers text changes, switches, etc.)

2. Create a function that turns a random string from lowercase to uppercase. For example, if the coming string is ‘lowkey’, the outcome should be ‘LOWKEY’. To spice up this challenge, usage of the .toUpperCase() method is not allowed.

## Description
